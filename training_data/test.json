Water turns into ice before these blood-sucking monsters, and their victims realize that this uncanny chill is the harbinger of their inevitable demise. Fortunately, the number of vampires is dwindling thanks to the dauntless bounty hunters who track down and slay the near-immortal predators.\n\r\nOne night, tragedy befalls the Elbourne family as their daughter, Charlotte, is abducted by Meier Link, a revered vampire lord protected by an army of monsters. To save their beloved Charlotte, her family recruits the Marcus Brothers, a group of vampire hunters known for their ruthlessness; and D, a sword-wielding dhampir—a half-vampire, half-human who has the strengths of both species and the weaknesses of neither.\n\r\nThe hunters rush to rescue Charlotte, but if her abductor decides to turn her into a vampire, they should eliminate her. Moreover, their mission must be completed before Meier reaches the impregnable vampire castle of Carmilla and takes Charlotte out of humanity's reach forever.\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\"\nGenres: Action, Drama, Fantasy, Horror, Romance, Sci-Fi, Vampire\n\nBased on this information, classify the anime strictly as one of the following: \"Top-tier\", \"Worthwhile\", \"Watchable\", or \"Terrible\".",

Yet, as time passed, such stories became little more than relics of the past.\n\r\nAfter quickly finishing his business in the village, Lawrence sets out to his next destination. His journey, however, takes an unexpected turn when he discovers a nude, animal-eared girl sleeping among his pelts. Even more surprisingly, the youthful-looking woman claims to be Holo—the wolf of legend.\n\r\nHolo wishes to return to her hometown in the north, and though their first encounter is rocky, she convinces Lawrence to accompany her on her travels. In return, she vows to earn her keep, using her quick wits and lifetime of experience to help her newfound companion in his dealings. As they continue their journey, Lawrence and Holo take advantage of whatever economic opportunities they come across, often landing in situations that put both their business skills and their relationship to the test.\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\"\nGenres: Adventure, Drama, Romance, Supernatural, Adult Cast\n\nBased on this information, classify the anime strictly as one of the following: \"Top-tier\", \"Worthwhile\", \"Watchable\", or \"Terrible\".",

However, high schooler Karin Maaka is unusual, even among her own kind. Unlike her vampire family, ever since she was a child, Karin has suffered from polycythemia: a rare disorder which causes her to periodically produce excessive amounts of blood. And the more blood she produces, the more anemic and lightheaded she gets, ultimately leading to frequent nosebleeds.\n\r\nHer only solution? Force her excess blood onto random strangers, which surprisingly causes these \"victims\" to become livelier and happier than before. With her siblings—Anju, her reserved yet affectionate younger sister, and Ren, her womanizing elder brother—helping her abilities remain a secret by altering the affected humans' memories, no one is the wiser. That is, until Karin's newly transferred classmate, Kenta Usui, finds her behavior suspicious. And to make matters even more complicated, Karin feels her blood reacting unusually to Kenta's presence.\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\"\nGenres: Comedy, Romance, Supernatural, School, Vampire, Shounen\n\nBased on this information, classify the anime strictly as one of the following: \"Top-tier\", \"Worthwhile\", \"Watchable\", or \"Terrible\".",
