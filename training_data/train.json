However, when they take on a high-rated delivery to bring an orphan girl named Alvis Hamilton to the battleship Silvana, they get dragged into a much greater conflict that pits them against the might of the Guild.\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\"\nGenres: Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi\n\nBased on this information, classify the anime strictly as one of the following: \"Top-tier\", \"Worthwhile\", \"Watchable\", or \"Terrible\".",
